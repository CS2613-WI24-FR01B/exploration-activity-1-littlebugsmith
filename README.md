# EA1: pygame

This project is an exploration of the popular [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library for Python. The goal of the attached program is to demonstrate its many useful functionalities for graphical game design. With the guidance of a [helpful and in-depth tutorial](https://coderslegacy.com/python/pygame-platformer-game-development/) from [CodersLegacy.com](https://coderslegacy.com/), I created a 2D platforming game with basic color-shape graphics, vector-based gravity, collisions (with the built-in pygame 'spritecollide()' function), and a score variable. The game is simple but engaging and easy to customize. It can be accessed from any regular Python compiler or a terminal window. Enjoy!
