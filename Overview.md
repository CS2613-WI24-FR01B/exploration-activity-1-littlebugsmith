# An Overview of the Pygame Python Library

Pygame is a free and popular open-source extension library created to support rudimentary to complex game design within Python architecture. Since its creation in 2000, it has been used in thousands of games and applications with downloads estimated in the millions. Built as a direct extension of the SDL library, pygame carries a wide array of features for the ground-up programming and subsequent optimization of 2D games. A satisfying feature of the library is its widespread use of C and Assembly functions for major functions, effectively multiplying the speed by 100x compared to Python proper. It is supported on a full spectrum of operating systems including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. There is even limited support for some classic video game console formats, such as Dreamcast, Atari, and AmigaOS! [1] The pygame library consists of several modules related to graphics (mainly via GUI), control input, audio, and a host of other interactive mechanics. The syntax is simple to pick up and very economical on both time and memory. [2] 

For this project I felt like covering something related to game design, so I decided to familiarize myself with pygame.
The time I spent learning its methods was worth it and taught me more about game design principles than I expected. The most surprising part was realizing how easy it is to turn a clunky terminal spreadsheet into a fully functional game, with minimal keystrokes
and from the comfort of your own terminal. Overall, I feel more clear on the logic, limits, and functionality of Python. Discovering pygame has already convinced me to further practice my gamemaking handiwork outside of school. On the theoretical side, using it broadened my horizons as I realized how much cross-compatibility between languages (i.e. Assembly, C) is possible with Python. It's a great example of a tool which can easily be enjoyed by beginners and expert developers alike.
