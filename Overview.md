# An Overview of the Pygame Python Library

Pygame is a popular extension library created to support rudimentary to complex game design within Python architecture. Since its creation in 2000, it has been used in thousands of games and applications. [1]

The pygame library consists of several modules related to graphics (mainly via GUI), control input, audio, and a host of other interactive mechanics. The syntax is simple to pick up and very economical on both time and memory. [2] For this project I felt like covering something related to game design, so I decided to familiarize myself with pygame.
The time I spent learning its methods was worth it and taught me more about game design principles than I expected. The most surprising part was realizing how easy it is to turn a clunky terminal spreadsheet into a fully functional game, with minimal keystrokes
and from the comfort of your own terminal. Overall, I feel more clear on the logic, limits, and functionality of Python. Discovering pygame has already convinced me to further practice my gamemaking handiwork outside of school. It's a great example of a tool which can easily be enjoyed by beginners and expert developers alike.
